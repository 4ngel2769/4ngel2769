I'm a developer and embedded systems engineer and student in Cybersecurity. I create full-stack web projects (front-end and back-end), build embedded systems - such as robotics, IoT, and handheld devices - and work extensively with Linux servers, automation, virtualization, and DevOps.

I have 6 years of practical experience with Linux, 5 years of web development experience (1 professionally), and 2 years of experience with embedded systems, including 1 year in a professional role.

__Embedded Systems & IoT__: Designing and programming IoT devices, robots, firmware, and handheld tools, turning my ideas into working prototypes.
- The chips I work with are the **ESP32**, **RP2040**, **Atmega328p**, **STM32**, and classic **Raspberry Pi arm boards**.
- For PCB Design
- Wireless Communication over WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, ZigBee, and custom RF frequencies.

__Web development__: Building full-stack web apps focusing on performance, scalability, and user experience.
- **TypeScript** is my primary language for front-end, as for the back-end, I prefer to *go* with **Go** or **Python**.
- I use modern frameworks like **React**, **Nuxt.js**, and **Svelte** for front-end development.
- For back-end development, I use **Go** and **Python** but also **Node.js** with **Express**.

### Currently Learning
- Some programming languages (`Lua, JS, TS, Py, Java, C++`)
- Databases (`SQL, mongoDB, redis`)
- PCB and circuit design (`mostly with KiCad`)
- Embedded systems (`esp32 & esp8266, atmega328p, STM32WB55`)
- Long/short range radio comms (`LoRa, nRF905, cc1101, esp32's BT and WiFi`)

### What I'm Working On

- **Network and Server Management**
  > Managing a swarm of Linux machines/VPSs running Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters.

  ### To see the status of my servers, you can visit [status.angellabs.xyz](https://status.angellabs.xyz).
  
  > I use the following tools to manage my servers:
  > - [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) for configuration management.
  > - [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) for infrastructure as code.
  > - [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) for container orchestration and management.
  > - [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) for secure remote access and networking.
  > - [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io) for managing Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters.
  > - [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com) for kvm/qemu virtualization and container management.
  > - [Cloudflare Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/) for securely exposing services to the internet without the need for a public IP address or having ports open.
  > - [Coolify](https://coolify.io) for managing self-hosted applications and websites. (A wonderful alternative to Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify. Highly recommend it!)
  > - [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) for home automation and IoT device management.
  > - [Grafana](https://grafana.com) and [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) for server monitoring and alerts.
  > - [Traefik](https://traefik.io) and [NginxProxyManager](https://nginxproxymanager.com) for reverse proxy and load balancing.

- **[Helix](https://github.com/4ngel2769/Helix)** A Discord bot written in TypeScript.
  > Helix is a multipurpose bot that can be used for moderation, music, and fun in Discord servers.
  It is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use. It uses the Discord.js library for interacting with the Discord API and will soon be run on Docker containers for easy deployment and management.
  At its core, Helix uses the [Sapphire](https://github.com/sapphiredev/framework) framework, which provides a solid foundation for building Discord bots using TypeScript.

- **Swappable Brain Board**
  > A single-board PCB powered by an ESP32 microcontroller with most of what you need for robotics and IoT projects.
  The goal of this project is to create a single board brain to no longer need to always solder boards or esp modules in projects.
  Instead, you can just plug in the board and have it ready to go. This will allow you to easily swap out the board from a project and use in another without worrying about needing to desolder or rewire things.

- **Hosting**
  > I use [Coolify](https://coolify.io) to manage my self-hosted applications and websites like [angellabs.xyz](https://angellabs.xyz) and [Helix](https://github.com/4ngel2769/Helix).
  > I also host my own DNS server and VPSs for some friends and family.
  > Coolify is a very useful tool for deployment, rollbacks, and scaling of applications.

- **Many Side Projects**
  > I'm always learning new things, and naturally, I start small projects to test and experiment with newfound knowledge. You can find those in **[4ngel2769/side-projects](https://github.com/4ngel2769/side-projects/)**.
